## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, or WARNINGs. 

There was one NOTE because this is the first submission to CRAN.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

## Resubmission
This is a second resubmission. In the first resubmission, we:

* Modified the DESCRIPTION to not begin with "This package."

* Ensured that functions do not write by default or in examples/vignettes in the user's home filespace, writing to `tempdir()` instead.

In this resubmission, we:

* Fixed a problem introduced in the examples when switching from the user's home filespace to `tempdir()` and force checked all examples by bypassing `\donttest{}` (implemented to save system time) temporarily.
