### gbfs 1.10

-   Thanks to Mark Padgham (@mpadge), we've introduced a new function `get_gbfs_cities` that lists all of the cities currently releasing feeds! This function will help inform users who do not have a specific city already in mind.
-   Minor bug fixes (unused imports, vignette errors, etc.)

-   Add functionality for new column types introduced in the new NABSA GBFS guidelines
